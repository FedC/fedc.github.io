<h1>About</h1>
  <h2>We create spaces that inspire people to dwell.</h2>
  <p>We envision impacting the lives of our clients through spaces that convey a sense of belonging to a place. The place chosen for a home, office, or cultural venue is imbued with significance. This along with each client’s needs and desires inform our design concepts and processes. When spaces effectively address the natural + man-made surroundings and the uniqueness of a client, inhabitants of that architecture experience dwelling.</p>

  <h1>Services</h1>
  <p>Experienced in new construction and renovations, our various services are organized into six design phases.
  The scope of each project informs the phases required, as well as the services included within each phase.
  Approvals may be required to proceed to a subsequent phase.</p>
  
    <h2>Pre-Design</h2>
    <p>Code research, site analysis, and programming (the identification of the owner's needs, wants, and desires) are the essential tasks that inform the requirements and concept for the project.</p>
  
    <h2>Schematic Design</h2>
    <p>The concept for a project is conceived and communicated via sketches and 3D renderings. Drawings map out the exterior, interior, and systems of the building.</p>
  
    <h2>Owner/Stakeholder Approval (1)</h2>
    <p>Drawings are ready for submittals to HOAs, city design boards, or community review groups. Preliminary cost estimates can also be generated.</p>
  
    <h2>Design Development</h2>
    <p>Engineers and consultants are added to the process. Materials, finishes, equipment, and fixtures are selected and specified.</p>
  
    <h2>Owner/Stakeholder Approval (2)</h2>
    <p>Updated drawings are reviewed again with owners and stakeholders before moving to final construction docs.</p>
  
    <h2>Construction Documents</h2>
    <p>Final permit drawings and documents are produced, compliant with all local codes.</p>
  
    <h2>Permit</h2>
    <p>Permit applications are submitted. Architects manage revisions and responses until permits are approved.</p>
  
    <h2>Bidding & Negotiation</h2>
    <p>Owner selects delivery method and contractor. Architect helps review bids and clarify scope.</p>
  
    <h2>Construction Administration</h2>
    <p>The architect ensures construction meets drawings. They handle change orders, RFIs, walkthroughs, and project closeout.</p>

      <p><strong>Status:</strong> Built</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Challenges included:  1. balancing between the limited size of the site and the patron’s desired building area, 2. capturing the desired views despite the pie-shaped site at the end of a cul-de-sac with large residential homes on both sides and a line of protected mangroves along the perimeter seawall, 3. complying with local design guidelines regulated by “style”, and 4. receiving approval from a multi-level process including architectural review boards at the local building association and city levels.
</p>
      <p>A two-story, T-shaped plan is oriented on the site to 1. control the desired views down the length of the waterway and 2. separate the public parking court from the private pool/patio area.  The house sits on a raised plateau, creating privacy from the street and satisfying the requirement for break-away walls for protection during flooding.
Perceived as “private” from the street, the interior spaces offer an element of surprise due to their openness and integration with the surrounding exterior patios, enclosed garden, and water-views.  The transition of spaces from the public realm to the various private interior spaces was a predominant driving force for the design.   A two-story entrance foyer unifies the two distinct volumes of the house with the use of exposed concrete for the walls and floor.  This tall and narrow space extends into the adjacent spaces:  living & dining on the first floor and playroom & master bedroom suite on the second.  The more private functions are progressively organized away from this core.</p>

      <p>Designed as phase one of a two-phase expansion project, this 500,000 car parking facility blends in with the existing 2-story parking structure in function and design, despite its much larger scale.  The new structure consists of 7 floors, with three light wells evenly organized along its northern and southern lengths.  The first floor is double-height to relieve vehicular height restrictions, allow light to the lowest level and to communicate to the driver his arrival to the bottom level.  There are three ramps for vertical vehicular circulation, one of which is a circular ramp attached to the east façade to break up the scale of the elevation.  The other two ramps are sloped parking bays.  Along the north and south elevations, open-air stairwells of exposed masonry are rhythmically aligned along its lengths and form part of the six main pedestrian circulation cores. 
Pedestrian cores are organized at each end of the three light wells.  At each circulation core, a stainless steel elevator, exposed concrete fixed furniture and accessories, and exposed masonry stairwell are contrasted with vibrantly colored fiberglass cylindrical enclosures around stainless steel mechanical stairwells.  This contrast between cold and warm materials and colors serve as landmarks for orienting the traveler to and from these pedestrian cores within the vast sea of cars parked at each level.  The fiberglass cylinders are a collaboration with New York artist, Jodi Pinto, and are the product of the organizing efforts of Art in Public Places.
wayfinding:  clear definition of vehicular and pedestrian circulation patterns, via: – clearly defined gathering spaces or pedestrian cores – strong forms – contrasting warm and cold materials and colors.</p>

      <p>An art curator desired her historically designated home to be transformed into a background for her private modern art collection.</p>
      <p>Located within a Historic District, local codes allowed no modifications to the exterior architecture and limited modifications to the interior.  Extensive structural damage required the strategic reinforcement of the stairwell and other areas, requiring close coordination with the structural engineer during construction and the accounting of the percentage of structure allowed to be revised to maintain the historic designation of the home.</p>
      <p>The interior of this home was enhanced to pay homage to its local heritage.  At the same time, his residence is in its essence a modern art gallery. Four interventions within its interior are strategically designed to serve as both the backbone and background to its surrounding spaces:
- Stair
- Pantry
- Master Closet/Laundry and Restroom
- Sliding Doors

Modern in their vocabulary, these interventions support, highlight, and influence the decisions on materiality and finishes of other elements within the historical spaces.

The exterior spaces extend the historical and modern vocabularies into the landscape design (by others), via the use of color, textures, and foliage.

      <h2>Boca Raton Museum of Art</h2>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> Boca Raton, Florida</p>

      <p><strong>Status:</strong> Built</p>

      <p></p>
      <p>The Museum Board presented the following challenges:
- Organize 45,000 square feet of spaces for exhibition, storage, reception, lecture, gathering, and shopping throughout an oddly-shaped 1.3 acres.
- Establish an ambiance unique to the museum while being an integrated piece of the city's envisioned cultural park.
- Balance the social need for spaces with natural light and the collection's requirements for controlled light, temperature, and humidity.
- Oversee an extensive design review process, including Museum Board reviews aimed towards consensus building and the city's reviews for development compliance with its Community Redevelopment Agency.</p>
      <p>The site, an oddly shaped 1.3 acres, at the northernmost end a two-story outdoor shopping plaza, was gifted by the City to jump-start a Cultural Park.  The City aspires to have a Concert Hall and an outdoor amphitheater adjacent to the museum.  The perimeter for a future 2-story colonnade for the amphitheater is to function as a “unifying element” to the museum.
The museum’s entry point responds to the concept of the Cultural Park.  The entrance courtyard was designed to satisfy two needs:  establishment of an ambiance unique to the museum and separate access for children anticipated in the educational program.
The social needs of the museum demand spaces with natural light and a strong sense of community.  The Main Hall, a 44-foot high space filled with light from the entrance courtyard and from the light monitor above, connects visitors to the first and second floor galleries, meeting room, and gift shop.
The exhibits require spaces with controlled light, temperature and humidity.  The galleries, away from natural light, are organized to fit the needs of the museum with flexible spaces for traveling exhibits on the first floor and various display spaces for the permanent collection on the second floor.
The design focuses on the image and shape of ongoing life, focussed in the careful distribution and balance of natural light and controlled lighting systems, geometry that negotiates between exterior and interior forces, functional spaces responding to the year-long requirements for flexibility, and ornament inspired by the nature of the material itself and the available technology.</p>

      <p>World Savings and Loan Bank of Oakland, California balances business acumen with an interest in and a commitment to design.</p>
      <p>The client seeks one-of-a-kind designs for their buildings, each uniquely satisfying an extensive set of design & business standards developed over 20 years and throughout 250 branch banks.  While the site location was ideal, its narrow and long proportions brought to question whether the tested and established spatial requirements for walk-up and drive-thru customer experiences could be met.  Visibility and identification from both the highway and the center’s co-anchor tenant are pre-requisites.  This facility needs to be opened daily with a minimum of two employees; instituting the CPTED (Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design) principle of eyes on the community through minimal staffing resources strategically positioned within the facility.  This required increased visibility throughout the facility while minimizing the view of the drive-thru-teller from the walk-up teller.</p>
      <p>The branch is an open, linear plan in which the customer areas are clearly identified, the teller line easily accessible, and all banking functions convenient and obvious.  The predominant exterior feature is the large, red volume.  Occupying the corner parcel of a dispersed strip-shopping center, this element serves as a visible landmark for both World Savings and the shopping center itself.  Its shear scale addresses that of the adjacent highway and the vast parking lot, orienting the passerby and banking customer.  Meanwhile, the interior and exterior spaces defined by the sloped standing seam metal roof system defines the public realms of the walk-in and drive-thru patrons, respectively.
The interior is zoned into public, semi-public, and private areas.  The teller area, as part of the public realm, is reinforced by the exposed structural system, exposed mechanical systems, and the use of color and a custom translucent lighting system.  The accounts services area, as the semi-public realm, exhibits the absence of the afore-mentioned features, utilizing a dropped ceiling and glass walls.  The more private vault and employee lounge are located at the extremities of the facility and anchor the building at opposing ends of the linear plan.</p>

      <h2>Wiebe Residence</h2>
      <p><strong>Location:</strong> Davie, Florida</p>
      <p><strong>Use:</strong> Residential</p>
      <p><strong>Area:</strong> 3700</p>
      <p><strong>Status:</strong> Built</p>
      <p></p>
      <p></p>
      <p>A original builder's mound situated at the center of the property suggested the placement of a future home with no consideration for the natural and man-made assets of the site and its surrounding context.  The challenge was to make the most of the natural conditions and tie into the suburban fabric in a fresh and innovative way, within a tight budget.</p>
      <p>The southern half of a .5 acre suburban lot is reserved for development.  This approach maximizes the use of the northern portion of the site for green space and privacy from the surrounding residences.  Three volumes are organized on the site to create a spatial continuity with the rhythm of structures that line along the front yards of the street and to embrace the end of the cul-de-sac they occupy.
A tall volume slices through a lower one.  A third volume is introduced at the intersection to create the entry breezeway to this private residence.  The volumes are limited to a maximum of 20’ in width and oriented to maximize the flow of predominant winds through the spaces.  Openings to the south are minimized in size and quantity to minimize heat gain.  Larger openings to the north assist in pulling ventilation through the spaces and maximize the view to the north of the site, reserved for green space.
The tall volume houses the more public living spaces.  The lower volume houses the sleeping and play areas.  The third volume is reserved for parking and storage.
The spaces within the tall volume are defined by walls and cabinetry organized along the center of the space, away from the exterior walls, allowing for continuous circulation along the entire interior perimeter of the volume.
Materials and colors are manipulated to further integrate the three volumes into a unified whole.  Within the larger volume, masonry block and the metal deck roof are left exposed to celebrate the use of these local materials.  The exposed masonry block and colors within the larger volume are extended into the spaces of the lower volume to define the playroom and the master suite, the spaces that transition into opposite sides of the lower volume.  While playful, the use of color is deliberately distributed to define a series of unifying systems that were essential throughout the design process.  The exposed concrete floor is the single unifying element that remains constant throughout the entire design.</p>

      <p><strong>Area:</strong> 1700</p>
      <p><strong>Status:</strong> Built</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>This ranch-style home nestled within a suburban community, near Fort Lauderdale’s beaches, was in its original condition since 1976.  A galley kitchen, dining room, living room, and Florida room - compartmentalized into independent spaces - looked tired.  Bathrooms were small and equipped with worn standard cabinetry and fixtures.  Windows required the cumbersome maintenance and adjustment of shutters no longer compliant for hurricane protection.</p>
      <p>The owner wished for the house to have a stronger presence from the street, more of a connection between the main living areas and the front and back yards, an efficient and fluid use of interior spaces, additional storage capacity in the kitchen, easy access to laundry, and more spacious bathrooms and living areas.  The budget did not allow for expansion of the existing spaces.</p>
      <p>A re-evaluation of circulation patterns, removal of walls, implementation of simple forms, use of local materials, increased storage capacity, and selection of a warm color palette were predominant considerations. 
The following notions were the driving force of the design:
- Enclose an entry garden vs. raise the roofline of the entrance porch (the owner's original thought);
- Extend the living room into the kitchen vs. kitchen spilling out into living room;
- Implement long, narrow, linear elements within the bathrooms to visually extend the perceived measurement of the otherwise small spaces;
- Unify the surrounding front and back patios through the use of similar paver patterns and individual stepping stones - introducing a more personal scale consistent with the quaint size of the home;
- Dedicate a portion of the budget towards high quality landscape design and installation - as well as identifying a contractor that would provide the same and continue future maintenance.</p>
